                        <p> Hello! My name is Roger Kinney, and im a 34 year old male from Sacramento Ca. I started my life in the military, visited many countries such as Australia, Iraq, Egypt, Germany, Ireland and even Kuwait. I have a bachelors in criminal justice and worked in law enforcement for about 5 years. I always get asked why do I want to switch careers? Work life balance is important, and as a Iraq veteran suffering with severe PTSD, I found that my career choice wasnt the best. I took a lot of interest and actually coded when I was in highschool. I even managed to make a few pages about the origional LOTR series. I want a field that challenges me and takes me out of my comfort zone so, software dev seems like an idealistic choice. 
                        </p>

                            <p>The UC Davis bootcamp taught me both up to date, widely used programming languages coupled with respective framework all resulting in a successful entry level full stack developer skillset. The curriculum is heavily project-based, and required me to immediately put fast paced learned concepts into practice. I was capable of building fully functional web-apps, do data analysis and use real dev tools just weeks into my programs. I worked countless hours outside of the program to improve my skillset with having none from day one.  A self starter by nature, coupled with professional partners on projects, I found myself able to capitalize on instruction and the corrective criticism on a functioning team. </p>
